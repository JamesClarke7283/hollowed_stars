GAME IDEA

The game is a real time strategy game where you command a massive
arkship that contains the last surviving remnant of humanity and our
fleet across a galaxy built on our ruins, looking for a place to call
the new home for what is left. Your only goal is to save the human
species, and it will be an arduous task. Most planets are already
inhabited by new upstart civilisations who look to our advanced
technology with greed and hunger. While some may be willing to trade to
gain access to our secrets, just as many will try to take advantage of
our state as a shattered remnant.

While on your journey there will be shipwrecks and remnants of the old
federation that used to be the dominant force in the known universe, but
has since disappeared completely for unknown reasons. As well as the old
ruins, there are new species that have risen from the ashes of our
galaxy, armed with technology inferior to ours, and a hunger to fix that
-- starting by taking your ship and the scientists onboard. To the
aliens of the galaxy, we are precursors. An ancient civilisation beyond
peer. We have more individual might, but they have numbers.

Looking back at the ruins that humanity left behind, you can salvage the
derelicts for materials to repair your dying ship, or discover that they
are not as dead as you first thought and trade with the aliens, or evade
their attempts at capturing you. You will also discover the still
functioning machine-driven military forces of the old federation, and
while it is advisable to run and hide from them, there are definite and
extremely powerful benefits to defeating them. If you defeat them.

The combat system would be 2d and based on an orbit simulation, with you
attempting to intercept the orbit of your enemy so you can launch a
salvo of missiles, railgun shells, beams and combat drones (classified
as a weapon rather than a ship type) to ruin their day - with range,
accuracy, rate-of-fire and damage being the main considerations, each
having their advantages and disadvantages.

Plot:

The basic premise is that you are the Admiral of the last fleet of
humanity, sent off from a colossal, dying space station that survived
the death of the rest of our species by hiding in the heart of a star
(something that in that time, was easy). The fleet is based entirely
around your mothership, a multi-kilometre long vessel that carries
millions of colonists, all frozen in cryogenic sleep. The mothership
would be selected at the start of the game from a selection (new
starships being unlocked after gaining different achievements), with
each having different specifications, allowing it to act in ways that
would be impossible for others. Each game is procedurally generated by
having the star systems available to you (the reason for this according
to lore is it being an alternate set of coordinates available to the FTL
drive).

Included must be a sort of captain's log, containing lore and optional
tasks (connected to random events) that may provide either lore,
resources, or both.

Mothership:

The mothership is the heart of your fleet and the last refuge of
humanity. Its primary role is to act as a storage, factory, carrier,
command and ark of your fleet. Depending on the mothership chosen during
game setup this purpose can be more shifted to one side or another, some
even making it a viable combat vessel. The systems of the ship are the
lifeblood of your fleet, some are responsible for the continued life of
the command crew (you) and your colonists and others are the thrusters
of your ship. They can be upgraded or replaced with better versions and
have the components that make them up be upgraded and replaced, for
example, you could upgrade your power systems so you can run better and
more varied equipment but you can also replace the individual modules
with better versions.

The best weapons and equipment are the still-working remnants from the
old federation, it is better in every possible way to whatever you could
ever hope to make. It is found in the shipwrecks and ruins of the old
federation and can be dangerous to get, but the risk is usually
(sometimes) worth it. You could use the technology manufactured by
aliens, but it is near universally worse than what you would be able to
build, the only advantage being how easy it is to obtain.

Fleet:

The mothership is not the only ship available to you, your fleet is
equally important. The ships that you use can be split into two
sections, combat and non-combat. Combat ships can further be split into
Fighters, Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Heavy Cruisers and
Battleships; this is listed in ascending order of size, cost and
firepower. Each ship can be customised and outfitted with different
weapons from an inventory that is constructed in the 'build equipment'
menu, though they have fixed weapon sizes. Each weapon size is distinct
in that small weapons are more effective at crowd control and attacking
lightly armoured enemies but larger ones are better at more armoured
single targets. Your combat ships are assigned a position in the
formation before combat and this formation order cannot be changed
during it, this paired with the fact that each time you match the orbit
of your enemy you have only a brief window in which you can actually
fight before you go back to attempting to intercept means that decisions
during combat must be methodical and well planned with a large period of
anxiety over whether your plan will succeed, building tension and
delivering large amounts of dopamine if you succeed but being agonising
if you fail. The second type of ship is Non-combat and these ships are
mainly used for scouting, mining and logistics. They are, while less
glamorous as their more violent brothers, equally as, if not far more
useful. Scout ships may be sent ahead to explore a dangerous location,
but are costly and can alert a threat to your presence.

Weapons:

Weapons are one of the most important things in this game, with each
type having their own specialisation and use. They are stored in the
equipment inventory with other ship modules, and can be selected to be
equipped onto your combat ships in the same way. To start, missiles are
the most basic and usually most effective weapon available to you. They
have excellent range and good damage, but they can be countered by good
point defence, cost a lot of resources and will often overkill any
smaller foe. This means that while they are near universally good and
will work in any situation, they are not always the best option. They
can also have many missile types loaded into it, from normal HE (high
explosive) missiles to nuclear missile and even (if you can find them)
old federation black hole missiles. Railguns are the second weapon type
and can absolutely demolish anything that enters medium range, but
suffer from the cost (though they cost massive energy to fire instead of
resources) and overkill problems. They are best suited to fighting large
and tough enemies that did not die within the first missile volley. They
fire once and take a long time to recharge, meaning that if faced with a
swarm of drones they will leave you defenceless. The third weapon type
is the SMAC or Scattering Missile Accelerator Cannon. This weapon is
essentially a missile that is accelerated from a railgun that splits off
into hundreds of high velocity slugs, each striking with a devastating
blow. This weapon has incredible material and energy costs but has
higher total damage than a railgun and can circumvent mid level PD
entirely. This makes it very good at removing anything that moves (and
anything that doesn't), its main problem being the colossal cost of each
SMAC missile and actually firing it. Autocannons are the fourth weapon
and the most effective way to deal with small or lightly armoured
targets; they have a small effective range but very good rate of fire,
low energy and material costs and never overkill a target. This makes
them good weapons, but they cannot be used exclusively as they will not
be able to take out anything larger than a corvette. Then there is the
fifth type, the laser. It is a highly powerful weapon that costs more
energy to fire than a railgun, but has no material costs. The damage
output that it can provide is very effective against both highly
armoured and lightly armoured enemies, never over-killing anything and
it cannot be stopped by PD. The main problems with it are the
unfathomable energy costs, high cost for it to be installed and the
relatively short range. Another thing to keep in mind about the laser is
that it can be set into a PD mode, making it a very powerful defensive
tool when faced with a large swarm of projectiles that you cannot avoid
by any other means. The sixth weapon type is the PD (point defence)
cannon and it cannot directly attack an enemy. It instead performs the
role of destroying any incoming missile or drone before they hit or can
fire upon its intended target. It is both cheap to build and cheap to
fire, but it can only target one projectile at a time, but will destroy
that target with absolute certainty. That is all of the conventional
weapons which can be built by you, but there are still some other
weapons that can only be salvaged from old federation wrecks or
constructed exclusively by you. Most of these will be significantly
better versions of weapons that you already have, but there are some
that cannot be constructed by you at all. These weapons are the neutron
beam emitter, a devastating weapon that turns any biological life and
computers into pink goo or scrap respectively. It leaves behind the husk
of the ship you destroyed in perfect condition. Ignoring the fact that
all of the circuitry is destroyed of course. It can destroy nearly
anything with such ease that it is frightening, but will make any
complex salvage damaged to a point of no repair. Its energy cost is low
and its material cost is nonexistent and the range is equal to the
laser. The second old-federation technology is the anti-matter
conversion device. This terrifying weapon turns a small percentage of
the enemy craft into anti-matter, causing the entire vessel to explode
into a cloud of metal. This can destroy nearly anything but costs so
much energy that it is difficult to use all the way up into late-game
and leaves behind no salvage. It's range is equal to the railgun. The
last weapon is the experimental flagship beam. This colossal beam weapon
has range superior to missiles and great damage, but has the highest
energy cost in the game and is only available to the 'signal of dawn',
the old federation flagship that you can unlock as a playable ship by
reaching Earth and defeating the ancient defensive fleet that still
defends the dead world.

Travel:

Travel in this game is done in two ways, FTL and sublight.

FTL travel is what is used to travel between stars. Despite the fact
that you are moving at a speed of faster than light, it takes thousands
of years. To survive this, you and your crew go into cryogenic sleep
like your colonists until you reach your destination. While in cryogenic
sleep your mothership and fleet have their health level go down, meaning
that if you are to survive your voyage then you must ensure that
everything is at peak maintenance. Before each jump, a warning prompt
shows up to indicate that you are about to enter cryosleep for a jump.
At certain points in FTL travel, you can find an old federation relay
point that you can use to travel to another sector of the galaxy (a
level of the game, essentially)

While in sublight, you can enter orbit of a planet/object or match the
orbit of an anomaly and send down a survey probe and have a chance to
unlock an event. Events are randomly chosen occurrences that can allow
you to discover new equipment, new blueprints for technology, materials
and information on what destroyed the old federation. All of this
information is stored in the captain's log.

Like mentioned previously, combat is done in sub-light. You launch an
attack by intercepting the orbit of your enemy and firing the weapons
while they fire theirs. You set up the actions of a ship 2 turns in
advance during battle but the mothership is directly controlled by you,
with there being no wait for turns.

The true story:

There are to be many endings to this game. However, the true ending
consists of destroying the malevolent god that killed all of humanity
and crossing though the prototype gateway to another galaxy.

This is because the true story of this game is that 5000 years ago,
during the time of the old federation, the brightest minds were working
on a project that was to change the fate of humanity forever and bring
about a new era of prosperity, travel to another galaxy. This was going
to be accomplished by constructing a massive gateway that would allow a
ship, no matter how large, to instantly cross over to the Andromeda
galaxy. This gateway was completed and preparations were made for the
first test jump to happen, but before the ship could cross, an eldritch
god appeared from nowhere and, with a single action, turned the old
federation into a memory. The reasons for this are unknown and left to
speculation. Humanity only survived because at the same time, a vast
megastructure was sent to the centre of a star to perform research in
complete secret. An utterly massive federation blacksite intended to
never reveal it's secrets. When the federation was crushed, they were
trapped in a highly advanced space station that could survive the
crushing gravity and overwhelming heat, the station that, 8000 years
later, would launch the mothership. The Being who destroyed humanity,
Ninurta, was weakened by the incredible expenditure of power and the
only reason why you can defeat them is because they are asleep when you
fight them, and even then it is the hardest fight in the game, with many
mind bending horrors and unspeakable things that lurk in the dark
emerging to tear your fleet apart.

You can reach this point by getting to Earth and unlocking the flagship,
which has the special item 'class 1 identification code', allowing you
to reach the gateway. You can find Earth by finding defeating a fully
active old federation fleet and stealing a 'class 4 identification code'
which gives you access to Earth.

This is what I have come up with so far. This is likely to change with
time.
