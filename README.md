## About

You are the Admiral of the last fleet of humanity, launched from a dying space
station hidden in the heart of a star. Your mothership carries millions of
colonists in cryogenic sleep across a dead galaxy — salvaging derelicts, trading
with alien species, and fighting to survive against the remnants of a fallen
federation's automated war machines.
